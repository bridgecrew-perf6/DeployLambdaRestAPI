Use Cases for AWS Lambda

Since AWS Lambda functions are stateless and event-driven, theyâ€™re particularly versatile for a number of scenarios. Common use cases in the context of AWS environments include:

- Changes to S3 buckets
- DynamoDB tables
- CloudWatch Events as triggers for Lambda functions
- Serverless backends with API Gateway
